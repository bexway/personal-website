    <div class="about-text">
        <p>I'm Bex, and I'm an optimistic, self-driven worker with a strong interest in web development. I'm currently in Northwestern University's Coding Boot Camp and loving everything I learn! Both the front and back ends of development interest me, and I'm working on my skills as a full-stack developer. I love coding and creating, and my favorite part is always having something new to learn.</p>
        <p>I've learned a lot in class and built some applications in a variety of languages. In my spare time, I'm working on my Python skills. I've used Python for most of my personal projects, and it's my first and favorite programming language. When I'm not coding, I like cooking and playing board games.</p>
