    <div class="about-text">
        <p>I'm Bex, and I'm an optimistic, self-driven worker with a strong interest in web development. I'm a Northwestern University alum, both for my Bachelor's in Linguistics and Cognitive Science and for my certificate in their Coding Boot Camp. I love the front and back ends of development, and I'm continually improving my skills as a full-stack developer. My favorite part of coding is finding new, improved, and creative ways to solve problems and create amazing apps. I also have a background in research, where I've presented work in degree semantics, written the code for social science experiments, and worked with student researchers writing grant proposals in a variety of subjects.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I'm working on my Python skills. I've used Python for most of my personal projects, and it's my first and favorite programming language. I'm also working on expanding my knowledge of PostCSS, especially its SASS-like plugins, so my sites can be both functional and beautiful! When I'm not coding, I like cooking and playing board games.</p>
