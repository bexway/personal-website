    <div class="about-text">
        <p>I'm Bex, and I'm a software engineer with a passion for words both in and out of code. My daily work focuses on software engineering in Python for <a class="content-link" href="https://shoprunner.com/">ShopRunner</a>, an ecommerce startup near the Loop in Chicago. I've worked on building features in an Agile environment using Python, MySQL, PySpark, and AWS services. I'm enjoying working in a fast-paced and cooperative environment, where I can learn and teach something new every day!</p>
        <p>I'm a Northwestern University alum, for both my Bachelor's in Linguistics and Cognitive Science and for my certificate in their Web Development Boot Camp, where I was first a student, then a teaching assistant. I got my start in coding with Artificial Intelligence classes in the Cognitive Science curriculum, and I soon applied what I learned by creating experiments for NU's Child Language Lab and Infant Cognition Lab.</p>
        <p>One of my current goals is to expand into JVM, specifically Kotlin, and I have plenty to learn on that front! I've also been writing plenty of automated unit tests for features I build at work, and learning CI/CD practices from my coworkers to streamline our deployment processes. When I'm not coding, I like cooking and playing board games. I've lived in and around Chicago my whole life, and I hope to live in the Windy City for years to come!</p>
